Objects use other objects' fields/properties/members through inheritance and composition

Composition lets us make compound objects
	- E.g., a mathematical expression composed of simple expressions; or a grouping of shapes that consists of several shapes

Composite design pattern is used to treat both single(scalar) and composite objects uniformly
	- I.e., Foo and Collection<Foo> have common APIs

"A mechanism of treating individual(scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner"
